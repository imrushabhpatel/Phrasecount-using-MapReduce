# Phrasecount using MapReduce

 the required output is the first two (2) words in the line. Thus, for each line of the form:
Input: (1,“the cat in the hat”)
Output: (“the cat”, n) where n is the number of times the ‘key’ appears in the input
If the line contains a single word, then that becomes the key.
